# odin-recipes
Hello! It's recipes project from The Odin Project curriculum. 
I'm going to build a website containing recipes, which will have
a main page and several recipes pages. With that I'm going to
show my skills, which include things like HTML and website's
folder structure. HTML skills in turn include: HTML boilerplate, 
texts, lists, links and images. Hope it will be fun!
